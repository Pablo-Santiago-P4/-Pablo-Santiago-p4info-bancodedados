/**
 * Creates a `lodash` object which wraps `value` to enable implicit method
 * chain sequences. Methods that operate on and return arrays, collections,
 * and functions can be chained together. Methods that retrieve a single value
 * or may return a primitive value will automatically end the chain sequence
 * and return the unwrapped value. Otherwise, the value must be unwrapped
 * with `_#value`.
 *
 * Explicit chain sequences, which must be unwrapped with `_#value`, may be
 * enabled using `_.chain`.
 *
 * The execution of chained methods is lazy, that is, it's deferred until
 * `_#value` is implicitly or explicitly called.
 *
 * Lazy evaluation allows several methods to support shortcut fusion.
 * Shortcut fusion is an optimization to merge iteratee calls; this avoids
 * the creation of intermediate arrays and can greatly reduce the number of
 * iteratee executions. Sections of a chain sequence qualify for shortcut
 * fusion if the section is applied to an array and iteratees accept only
 * one argument. The heuristic for whether a section qualifies for shortcut
